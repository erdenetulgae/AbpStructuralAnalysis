In the first run, the highly conserved residue H45 of AbpA was input to HADDOCK (van Zundert et al., 2016) as directly involved in the binding interactions of AbpA and HSA. On the receptor side, the critical residue W203 of SA was used to anchor the docking of AbpA to SA in HADDOCK. W284 and Y276 were not specified as actively participating in the binding
